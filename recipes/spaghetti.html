    <p>One-pot spaghetti puts Italian sausage, pasta sauce, and noodles together for a 
        dish you can have on the table in less than 45 minutes. It doesn't get much 
        easier than this by cooking everything in one pot. Switch it up by using 
        ground beef, chicken, or turkey along with any other of your favorite ingredients, 
        such as sliced mushrooms.</p>

            Combine ground sausage, onions, and garlic in a large pot or skillet with 
            tall sides. Cook over medium heat until sausage is cooked through, 5 to 8 
            minutes. Drain and discard grease.

        <li><h4>Step 2</h4> <p>
            Stir pasta sauce, water, and Italian seasoning into the pot; bring to a 
            boil. Stir in spaghetti noodles, return to a boil, and cook, stirring 
            occasionally, until noodles are cooked through and sauce has thickened, 
            17 to 20 minutes. 
        </p></li>
